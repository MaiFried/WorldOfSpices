# World of Spices

The website was developed in my first year of studies as a combined project for the following courses:
* Website Development
* Interface Characterization and User Experience
* User Interface Design
* Website Accessibility

The site was designed according to the principles of UI and UX, and developed in HTML5 and CSS3 with the consideration of website accessibility principles.
